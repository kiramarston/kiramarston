# I'm putting my cats through Med school.

I am a recent [CodeClan](https://codeclan.com/) graduate, having decided to leave the exciting worlds of carpets and pizzas behind at the start of 2020. One of the primary driving forces behind that decision was the desire to fix the sort of broken systems that I worked with and relied upon heavily every day of my working life - systems designed for their designers, but not for the customers that were actually using them. Following on from that, I also have an insatiable interest in breaking down barriers in tech, in improving accessibility and faciliating ease of use for clients regardless of their own technical expertise. I am actively seeking out projects and employment with a focus in these areas in particular.









This will be a scintilating list of deployed projects once I actually deploy them.
